# Project Overview
The study focused on lower limb biomechanics during forward lunges, comparing trials with normal and extended step lengths and bodyweight vs. weighted conditions (barbell and dumbbell lunges). Using VICON motion capture, force plate data, and EMG sensors, I examined joint kinematics, loading rates, and muscle activation trends to assess biomechanical efficiency and potential injury risks. For this project, I analyzed EMG signals, knee and hip joint angles, and ground reaction forces (GRF) during forward lunges. The project applies data analysis and machine learning methodologies to assess muscle activation patterns and joint mechanics under different lunge conditions.

# EMG Signal Processing
- Applied band-pass filtering, full-wave rectification, and enveloping to extract muscle activation patterns.
- Conducted FFT analysis to examine frequency components and neuromuscular response under different lunge conditions.
- Used linear regression modeling to analyze relationships between muscle activation levels and joint kinematics.

# Joint Kinematics & Kinetics
- Processed knee and hip joint angles over time, computing angular velocity and range of motion.
- Compared vertical ground reaction force (GRF) loading rates between lunge variations.
- Assessed the effect of step length and added weight on joint loading and movement stability.

# Machine Learning & Data Insights
- Implemented regression models to predict muscle activation trends based on joint movement data.
- Used trend analysis and statistical modeling to assess how step length and external load influence knee stability.

# Results & Insights
- Found increased quadriceps activation in weighted lunges compared to bodyweight lunges, particularly in extended step trials.
- Observed higher knee flexion angles in extended lunges, potentially increasing joint loading and stability demands.
- Identified variations in ground reaction force (GRF) loading rates, with heavier weights contributing to greater impact absorption requirements.
- Regression models successfully correlated knee angle variations with muscle activation trends, providing insights into optimal lunge mechanics for injury prevention.
